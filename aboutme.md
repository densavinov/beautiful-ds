My name is Denis Savinov. Let me tell you about myself!

### What I do 

I'm a data enthusiast with interests in politics, sports, and predictive analytics. I've developed an interest in statistics and data during early stages of my undergrad and now I do it professionaly as well as part of self-development. 

Majority of my **professional** projects consist of 
* Coming up with an idea/ a way to leverage accessible data and assist upper management with making informed decisions  
* Scraping various databases, cloud or paid external data 
* Creating automated scripts or data workflows to clean, aggregate and load into consolidated tables
* Design and build a tool (dashboard, EUC, report, etc) for partners to make their data-driven decisions
* Engage with key business partners to communicate relevant insights and present the tool 

For my **personal** development within data field I regularly take data science courses, build advanced analytics models on open-source datasets, which you can find under **Projects** section.
