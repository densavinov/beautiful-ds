My name is Denis Savinov. Let me tell you about myself!

### What I do 

I'm a data enthusiast with interests in politics, sports, and predictive analytics. I've developed an interest in statistics and data during early stages of my undergrad and now I do it professionaly as well as part of self-development. 
Majority of my professional projects consist of scraping various databases, open-sources or paid external data. 



What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
